## Requirements
- Git
- Nodejs & NPM
- Postgres client
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Installation

#### 1. Clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ForestAdmin/forest-examples.git
$ cd forest-examples/expressjs/sql-database/multiple-databases/
```

#### 2. Create the postgres databases
```
$ docker-compose up
```

#### 3. Restore the database dumps
```
$ pg_restore -O -d forest_movies ../../../sample-data/dump-postgres/movies.dump -h localhost -p 5445 -U forest
$ pg_restore -O -d forest_meals ../../../sample-data/dump-postgres/meals.dump -h localhost -p 5446 -U forest
```

#### 4. Install NPM packages

```
$ npm install
```

#### 5. Export the required environment variables
Open the file `.env` and set the following environment variables:

```
DATABASE1_URL=postgres://forest:secret@localhost:5445/forest_movies
DATABASE2_URL=postgres://forest:secret@localhost:5446/forest_meals
FOREST_AUTH_SECRET=
FOREST_ENV_SECRET=
```

`FOREST_ENV_SECRET` and `FOREST_AUTH_SECRET` values will be set in the next step.


#### 6. Create your Forest Admin Account
Create your account at [https://www.forestadmin.com](https://www.forestadmin.com) and select the stack "Express/Sequelize".

**NOTICE**: The *forest-express-sequelize* and the code snippet steps are already done for you in this example.

Set the correct `FOREST_ENV_SECRET` and `FOREST_AUTH_SECRET` in the `.env` file.

#### 7. Launch your admin

```
$ node bin/www
```

#### 8. You're good to go

Finally, click *Next*, choose a project name and finalize your Forest account creation.

## How it works

Most of the code is simply based on the [Sequelize express-example repository](https://github.com/sequelize/express-example).

#### File: `models/index.js`

The variable `dbs` is an array of object that describes all your databases connections.

#### File: `app.js`

In the `forest-express-sequelize` middleware configuration, we pass all your database connections to the option `connections`.

### Directory: `models/`

Each database must have its own directory in the `models/` folder. Then all your database models have to be put in the right one.
